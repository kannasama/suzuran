## Project Root

| File | Owns |
|------|------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code guidance: design context, workflow rules, repo layout |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release history |
| `TODO.md` | Informal task list and ideas |
| `.impeccable.md` | Design context for impeccable skills |
| `.env.example` | Required env vars with safe defaults |
| `.dockerignore` | Docker build exclusions |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust package manifest — bin + lib targets, all dependencies |
| `Cargo.lock` | Locked dependency versions |
| `Dockerfile` | 3-stage build: rust-builder (1.85) → ui-builder placeholder → debian:bookworm-slim |
| `docker-compose.yml` | App + Postgres (16-alpine) services |
| `tasks/lessons.md` | Process rules and lessons learned (authoritative, git-tracked) |
| `tasks/codebase-filemap.md` | This file — lightweight codebase index |

## Source

| File | Owns |
|------|------|
| `src/lib.rs` | Crate root — re-exports `build_router()` for use by tests |
| `src/main.rs` | Entry point — reads `PORT`, initialises tracing, starts `axum::serve` |
| `src/app.rs` | Axum router — `GET /health` handler |

## Tests

| File | Owns |
|------|------|
| `tests/health.rs` | Integration test: spins up server on random port, asserts `GET /health` → 200 "ok" |

## Directories

| Directory | Owns |
|-----------|------|
| `docs/plans/` | Implementation plans — date-prefixed kebab-case filenames |
| `migrations/` | Database migrations (numeric-prefix naming: `0001_name.sql`) |
| `resources/` | App assets (logos, icons, etc.) |
| `scripts/` | Developer tooling scripts |
| `secrets/` | Local secret files (gitignored except README) |
| `ui/` | Web frontend source _(to be populated)_ |
